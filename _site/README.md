# Dan Taylor

This is the personal website of Dan Taylor. It uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), 
the static site generator along with [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) 
and it is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can find it at [dantaylor688.github.io](http://dantaylor688.github.io/).

The style was inspired by [this post](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/)

## Weightlifting ##
I enjoy olympic weightlifting in my garage gym. Here are some helpful links that have helped me with developing my technique and have influenced my training philosophy.


*   I would love to stricly follow the [Bulgarian Method](http://startingstrength.com/articles/bulgarian_training_moser.pdf) developed by [Ivan Abadjiev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Abadzhiev).
*	[John Broz](http://www.averagebroz.com/) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/BROZKNOWS) of big lifts by his lifters were my introduction to this philosophy. Here is a [forum](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=122395951) discussion in which he answers several questions.  
*	Since I work a lot and the little ones keep me from sleeping much, I instead follow the [Texas Method](https://www.t-nation.com/training/texas-method) for front squats with reasonable succes. I also use a similar idea to train the competitive lifts. (Heavy singles one day, work up to a heavy single plus backoff sets another day, and on the third day I just do the power versions of the lifts as a light day.) This adaptation has been working well for me and my schedule.
*	[Mobility 101](http://www.allthingsgym.com/mobility101/). Most of these videos are by [Kelly Starrett](http://www.mobilitywod.com/about/kellystarrett/). These help keep me going even with all the aches and pains.
*	Dan John on [front squats and clean and jerks](http://danjohn.net/2009/12/the-front-squat/)
*	[Articles](http://www.ironmind.com:8080/ironmind/opencms/Lifts/index.html) and [videos](http://www.allthingsgym.com/jim-schmitz-olympic-weightlifting-coaching-tips/) by Jim Schmitz
*	[A Training Program for Beginners](http://www.pendlay.com/A-Training-System-for-Beginning-Olympic-Weightlifters_df_90.html) by Glenn Pendlay
*	An [insane workout](https://www.t-nation.com/workouts/weekend-training-for-the-busy-guy) for when you are busy. (Note that you still need to be able to get a lot of sleep if you try this! Otherwise, you will not be able to recover.)

## Go ##
*	[Online Go](https://online-go.com/play)
*	[The interactive way to play Go](http://playgo.to/iwtg/en/). A great tutorial for beginners.
*	[Go for Dummies](http://gofordummies.blogspot.com/2012/05/no-no-shapes.html). This is just a funny blog post.

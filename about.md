title: About
---

I am currently the data analyst at Stratos Inc., a startup in Ann Arbor, MI. Previously, 
I was a research scientist at [Michigan Aerospace Corp.](http://www.michiganaerospace.com/), 
where I worked on applying machine learning algorithms and solving inverse problems. I 
have also been an adjunct lecturer at [Eastern Michigan University](http://www.emich.edu/math/), 
where I have taught Intermediate Algebra and Calculus I. 

I want a place to host a variety of items, including:

* My own research
* Applications to industry
* Career advice
* Expository notes
* Math education
* Anything else related to math or data analysis that doesn't fit in these categories

I welcome comments as a way for everyone to learn more.

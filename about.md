My name is Dan. I am currently the lead data analyst at Stratos Inc., a startup in Ann Arbor, MI. Previously, I was a research scientist at [Michigan Aerospace Corp.](http://www.michiganaerospace.com/), where I worked on applying machine learning algorithms and solving inverse problems. I have also been an adjunct lecturer at [Eastern Michigan University](http://www.emich.edu/math/), where I have taught Intermediate Algebra and Calculus I. 

This blog was inspired by my reading of [Terrance Tao's blog](http://terrytao.wordpress.com/). I want a place to host a variety of items, including:

* My own research
* Applications to industry
* Career advice
* Expository notes
* Anything else related to math or data analysis that doesn't fit in these categories

I welcome comments as a way for everyone to learn more.

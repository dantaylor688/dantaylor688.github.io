I am currently a computer scientist working on the autonomous vehicle at [GM](https://www.gm.com/all-news-stories/technology.html). Prior to this I spent time at [Ford Motor Company](http://www.ford.com/). Before that, I was the data analyst at (now extinct) [Stratos Inc.](https://stratoscard.com/), a startup in Ann Arbor, MI. Going even further back, I was a research scientist at [Michigan Aerospace Corp.](http://www.michiganaerospace.com/), 
where I worked on applying machine learning algorithms and solving inverse problems. I 
have also been an adjunct lecturer at [Eastern Michigan University](http://www.emich.edu/math/), 
where I have taught Intermediate Algebra and Calculus I. Here is a link to my [CV]({{ site.url }}/assets/about/dan_taylor_cv.pdf) or if you prefer a shorter version, you can see my 
[resume]({{ site.url }}/assets/about/dan_taylor_resume.pdf).

This site is a place to host a variety of items, including:

* My own research
* Applications to industry
* Career advice
* Expository notes
* Math education
* Anything else related to math or data analysis that doesn't fit in these categories

I welcome comments as a way for everyone to learn more.
